# IPL Data Analysis Dashboard
Developed an interactive Tableau dashboard analyzing Indian Premier League (IPL) data from 2008 to 2020. The dashboard provides insights into each season, featuring metrics like Title winner, Orange Cap (top run-scorer) and Purple Cap (top wicket-taker) winners, 4's and 6's per season, matches won based on toss decisions, and various other performance analytics. The project highlights player and team trends, enabling fans and analysts to explore the evolution of the IPL over the years.
